# Week-03

This is a Google Colab file for Week 3 project on Credit Card Fraud detection.

The model currently drops all NaN values, but in the future this is going to change.

# To do
1. Descriptions in the Colab file needs to be improved
2. Figure out how much data is needed to train the model :)
